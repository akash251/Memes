# Memes
A clean architecture meme app which stores fetched data into local database and then 
displays scrollable memes with author and title which can be refreshed to update the fetched data.
This project uses: 

 - Jetpackcompose for building ui
 - Dagger hilt for dependency injection
 - Room for caching data locally
 - Retrofit for making network calls
 - Coil for loading image
